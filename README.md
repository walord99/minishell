# MINISHELL - *A basic bash like shell in C* #



Was built according to the specification of the [42 project](https://github.com/walord99/minishell/blob/main/extras/minishell.pdf).

TLDR: only the builtins export, unset, echo, cd, pwd, env and exit needed to be implemented as well as pipes, input and output redirection and signal handling.
